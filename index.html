                    <p>My name is Timothy Cornwell, since I first considered going into the tech industry, I have always wanted to go into Web Developemnt or Cyber Security.
                        As this portfolio might suggest, I have chosen to pursue Web Developemnt, I have always been interested in how website operate and function ever since I 
                        discovered the "inspect element" feature on Google Chrome. Since then, I have taken steps to prepare myself to enter the field by going to study Computer Science
                        as my Bachelor's degree at the University of Houston-Victoria. I will have completed this objective in May 2024 by earning my degree. During my time as a student I have
                        had the opportunity to learn the necessary elements to Software Developement and coding. I first learned C++ as the introductory language, which pushed me to learning C# and Java next.
                        I wanted to explore other operating systems and coding languages, so I completed a Introduction to Linux course which introduced me to Bash and most importantly Python. 
                        Using Python, I have been able to practice and develope skills such as the core search and sorting algorithms. In my own time, I have practiced HTML and CSS in order to begin the journey
                        to becoming a Web Developer, and I have recently been introduced to JavaScript and have begun to explore the uses of it. To broaden my experience, I volunteered to join a team
                        to develope a web application using Blazer, Postgres, and Azure Data Studio that allows a user to view stream data pulled from sources such as the organization's website, facebook, and other sources.
                        This project is still ongoing, however, I have learned alot about the uses of Blazer and the utility of C#, SQL, and scripting. I aim to become a FullStack developer, and I am eager and excited for the journey
                        to completing this goal.
